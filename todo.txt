- Use openrouter models with a large token limit for maintaining long context.
- Implement context splitting with code or tooling agent for maintainable context.
- Source context from various histories: fungus, normal rag, main history, sessions history, agent history, MCP history.
- Add learned knowledge to the puzzle graph.
- Save entire memory events including time duration, queries, etc.
- Conceptualize a Kuro graph marking each MCP usage to logical categories (e.g., mcp-playwright, mcp-docker).
- Use llm orchestrator to call MCP events.
- Explore training a specialized model based on puzzle training usage for future enhancement.
- Investigate SakanaAI's Continuous Thought Machines project on GitHub to see maze-solving capabilities and relevance to puzzles.
- Use chaining of thought (cot) for enabling waiting conditions and async event handling in tasks.
