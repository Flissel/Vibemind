MCPTools Scaffold: context7.search

Purpose: Placeholder for Context7 search MCP server/tool.
Status: scaffold only (no transport/runtime implementation yet)

Notes:
- This aligns with ctx7.search command intent; keep both if both naming schemes are used.
- Configure via config.yaml/env vars; secrets must not be checked in.
- When ready, add entry to servers.json (type/command/args).
